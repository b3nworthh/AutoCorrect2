A merge of HotKeyTool.ahk (icons, .lnk app launching, systray/startup) and
AC2HotkeyRef.ahk (#HotIf Context column, Show Hidden, Scan All, INI hotkeys,
Export Cheatsheet).  HotKeyToolCacheMaker.ahk is no longer needed -- icons come
straight from the exe files and are cached in the background, and the .lnk scan
itself is cached to disk.

The user-facing documentation lives in HotkeyHubHelpText, just below, so that
there is one copy of it rather than two.  Press F1 in the window, or pick
Help / About from the systray menu, to read it without opening this file.

Notes for anyone editing this script:
  * Running scripts are found by enumerating hidden AutoHotkey main windows
    (their titles are the script paths) rather than by a WMI process query.
    That is much faster and works when the scripts are elevated and this tool
    is not.  WMI remains as a fallback.
  * Nothing blocks the GUI.  The window appears immediately; the script scan,
    the shortcut scan and icon extraction all run in timer slices afterwards.
  * App rows live in App.appRows, hotkey rows in App.hotkeyRows, and
    FinishBuild is the single place the two are merged into App.entries.
    Call it after changing either half.
  * Icon lookup for a script-row hotkey checks, in order: an  icon:  tag on
    the hotkey's own comment line (e.hkIconSpec), the central [HotkeyIcons]
    section of HotkeyHub_icons.ini (App.hotkeyIcons, keyed by
    NormalizeHK(hotkey)), a  ; HotkeyHubIcon:  line anywhere in the file
    (e.iconPath / e.iconNum, whole-file), then the central [Icons] section
    (App.scriptIcons, keyed by file name).  See IconFor() and
    ResolveHotkeyIconSpec().

OVERVIEW
One searchable list of every hotkey you actually have running, plus your favourite applications.  Pick a row and press Enter: hotkeys are sent to whatever window you were in before this opened, applications are launched. Press Esc to hide again -- the tool keeps running in the systray.

THREE KINDS OF ROW
  Script   Hotkeys parsed out of running, portably-run AHK scripts -- that is,
           a renamed copy of AutoHotkey.exe sitting beside a same-named .ahk
           file.  Files pulled in with #Include are followed too.
  INI      Hotkeys stored in acSettings.ini under [Hotkeys], labelled from
           acSettingsMetadata.json.
  App      Shortcuts (.lnk) from your favourites folders and the Start Menu.
           Enter runs these instead of sending a hotkey.

ABOUT SENDING HOTKEYS
Enter or double-click on a Script or INI row replays that hotkey's own keystrokes into whatever window was active before this opened.  Many of your hotkeys only do something inside one particular app, or only once some other condition already holds -- a #HotIf context, a mode the target script is in, text already selected, and so on.  Sent from here into the wrong window or state, a hotkey like that does nothing at all, or something you did not expect.  The Context (#HotIf) column and the Source column are your best clues for which window a hotkey actually needs.  Treat this tool as a reference and a launcher, not a guarantee that every row does something useful when sent.

Windows also blocks a non-elevated program from sending keystrokes into a window running as Administrator.  If this window's title bar does not say (admin) and the window you switched from was itself elevated, the send can silently do nothing at all -- no error, the keys just never arrive.  Run this tool as Administrator too if you regularly work in elevated windows.

THE FILTER BOX
Type several words to AND them together: 'date tool' finds rows matching both. Prefix a word with - to exclude it, so 'snip -angle' drops the angle ones.

Two or more characters search the whole row -- hotkey, action, context and source file.  A SINGLE character searches the raw hotkey only, so typing d finds !+d and ^d rather than every row with a d somewhere in its description. One character is nearly always a key you are hunting for, and the word Shift in the friendly name would otherwise make f match half the list.  Since applications have no hotkey, a one-character search never matches one; type two characters to find an app by name.

Presets, from the drop-down or typed:
  *conflicts   only hotkeys defined more than once
  *apps        only application rows
  *scripts     only hotkeys from script files
  *ini         only hotkeys from acSettings.ini
  *used        only rows you have actually used
Every source file name and every #HotIf context is added to that list
automatically.  Alt+Down opens it.

THE MODIFIER BOXES     ^ Ctrl    ! Alt    + Shift    # Win
Each one clicks through three states:

  greyed   '^ Ctrl'      don't care -- where they start
  ticked   '^ Ctrl'      must contain
  empty    '^ no Ctrl'   must NOT contain

Requiring is order-independent, which is the one thing the filter box cannot do: !+d and +!d are the same hotkey typed two ways.  Extra modifiers are allowed, so requiring Alt and Shift shows ^!+d as well as !+d.  Add 'no Ctrl' and that ^!+d drops out.  Set all four to 'no' and you are left with the bare keys -- F1, Esc, Space and so on.

The boxes AND with the filter box, so to find !+d specifically: require Alt and Shift, then type d.  Any box off greyed hides the application rows, since an application has no hotkey to match.

CLEAR
Empties the filter box, returns all four modifier boxes to greyed, and puts the cursor back in the filter box.  It deliberately leaves the four view toggles alone -- those are settings rather than a search.

THE VIEW TOGGLES
  Show hidden      Include hotkeys whose in-line comment contains the word
                   hide, plus commented-out hotkey stubs.
  Apps             Include the application rows.
  Scan all         Off: only scripts running from the AutoCorrect2 folder.
                   On: every running portably-run AHK script on the system.
  Friendly names   Ctrl+Alt+D rather than ^!d, in the list and in exports.
These four are remembered in acSettings.ini and can also be edited in
SettingsManager.

COLUMNS AND SORTING
Click a column header to sort by it, click again to reverse, and a third time to go back to scan order.  The choice is remembered.

The Used column counts how often you have sent or run each row, so sorting by it floats your real workhorses to the top.  Combine that with the *used preset to see only the rows you have ever touched.

CONFLICTS
Any hotkey defined more than once in the same #HotIf context is flagged with [dup] in the Action column.  Select one and the status bar names the other script and line number; the *conflicts preset shows just those.  Hotkeys in different #HotIf contexts are not conflicts, since only one is ever live. 

RIGHT-CLICK A ROW
Send the hotkey or run the application, copy the hotkey, copy the whole row, open the defining file at the exact line in your editor, or open the file's folder in Explorer.

EXPORT
The Export button offers an HTML cheatsheet that opens in your browser and prints nicely with Ctrl+P, a Markdown file, a CSV file, or the visible rows straight to the clipboard.  Whatever the filter and the modifier boxes are currently showing is what gets exported.

KEYS
  Enter or double-click   send the hotkey, or run the application
  Down and Up             move between the filter box and the list
  Ctrl+F                  jump back to the filter box
  F5                      rescan everything
  Ctrl+E                  export the HTML cheatsheet
  F1                      this help
  Esc                     hide the window; the tool stays in the systray

ICONS
Hotkeys from a script show that script's icon, if it has been told which one. There is no way to read the icon out of a running script, so it has to be named -- in either of two places.

The central map, Data\HotkeyHub_icons.ini, is usually the easier one, since it is a single file rather than an edit to every script:

  [Icons]
  AutoCorrect2.ahk = Resources\Icons\Psicon.ico
  DateTool.ahk     = Resources\Icons\calendar-Blue.ico
  MCLogger.ahk     = Resources\Icons\JustLog.ico
  SomeTool.ahk     = shell32.dll, 44

Keys are file names, so #Include'd files get their own entry rather than inheriting whatever their parent uses.  Relative paths resolve against the AutoCorrect2 folder; absolute paths and bare library names work too, and a trailing , N picks an icon out of a .dll or .exe.

Pick 'Write icon map template' from the systray menu and every script being scanned is written into that file, commented out and ready for paths.

The other place is a line inside the script itself, which wins over the map:

  ; HotkeyHubIcon: ..\Resources\Icons\calendar-Blue.ico

There a relative path resolves against the file the line sits in.  This one travels with the script, so it is the better choice for anything you share.

Scripts named in none of the places on this page show the generic AutoHotkey icon, which is a perfectly reasonable place to leave them.  Set Cfg.useScriptIcons := 0 near the top of HotkeyHub.ahk to use that icon for everything and skip the lookup.

PER-HOTKEY ICONS
The two places above are per script file.  A single hotkey can have its own icon instead, which wins over both of them -- handy for a hotkey that just launches one particular app, so it shows that app's icon rather than the generic AHK one.

Central map: add a [HotkeyIcons] section to the same Data\HotkeyHub_icons.ini, keyed by the hotkey itself rather than by file name:

  [HotkeyIcons]
  !+s  = ZMatrix.exe
  !q   = Resources\Icons\sticky.ico
  ^!+d = shell32.dll, 44

Modifiers can be typed in any order, same as everywhere else in this tool. If the value matches the exe or the display name of one of your App rows, that app's own icon is reused; otherwise it is treated as an icon spec exactly like the [Icons] section above -- so a plain path to a .ico, resolved against the AutoCorrect2 folder, works too, with or without a trailing , N.

In-line: add  icon:<name or path>  at the end of the hotkey's own comment. This one travels with the script, so it wins over the central [HotkeyIcons] map as well:

  !+s::Run('ZMatrix.exe')  ; Launch ZMatrix screensaver  icon:ZMatrix.exe
  !q::ShowStickyNotes()    ; Show sticky notes  icon:Resources\Icons\sticky.ico

MAKING YOUR OWN HOTKEYS LOOK GOOD HERE
Put a descriptive in-line comment on each hotkey line -- that comment is what the Action column shows and what the filter searches.  Without one, the list falls back to showing the code itself, which is rarely as readable.

Include the word hide in that comment to keep a hotkey out of the list unless Show hidden is ticked.  Useful for hotkeys that exist only as plumbing.  An  icon:<name or path>  tag, see PER-HOTKEY ICONS above, gives that one hotkey its own icon.

WHERE THINGS LIVE
This script sits in AutoCorrect2\Tools\ beside its renamed HotkeyHub.exe.  It finds the suite root by walking up from itself looking for Data\acSettings.ini, so nothing is hard-coded.

  Data\acSettings.ini  [HotkeyHub]   settings: toggles, sort, window position
  Data\acSettings.ini  [Hotkeys]     HotkeyHubHotkey = the activation hotkey
  Data\HotkeyHub_icons.ini           which icon each script or hotkey shows
  Data\HotkeyHub_usage.ini           how often each row has been used
  Data\HotkeyHub_apps.tsv            cached shortcut scan, safe to delete
  Debug\HotkeyHub_export.md / .csv   exports, when you ask for them

The last two are disposable -- delete them and they rebuild.  Run this outside the suite, with no Data folder next door, and everything falls back to sitting beside the script instead.

COLOURS
Taken from Data\colorThemeSettings.ini, which ColorThemeIntegrator writes, so this tool matches the rest of the suite.  Fallback colours are set near the top of the script if that file is missing.

TUNING
The USER OPTIONS section at the top of HotkeyHub.ahk holds the rest: which folders are scanned for scripts and for shortcuts, which files are skipped, the font size, the editor command used by the right-click menu, and how long the shortcut cache stays fresh.
